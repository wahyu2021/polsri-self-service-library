feat: Implement comprehensive notification system and loan management improvements

This commit introduces a robust notification system and enhances various aspects of loan management and student-facing features.

- Notification System:
  - Added new notification types (e.g., fine unpaid, loan due soon, overdue).
  - Implemented `NotificationController` for student notification management.
  - Created `notifications_table` migration and related UI components.

- Loan Management Improvements:
  - Added `is_fine_paid` column to `loans_table` for better fine tracking.
  - Updated `LoanController`, `LoanRepository`, and `LoanService` to support new loan features and notification triggers.

- Student Module Enhancements:
  - Modified `DashboardController`, `LoanController`, `ProfileController`, and `ScanController` to integrate new features and notification displays.
  - Introduced new student views and components for notifications and updated existing ones.

- General Refinements:
  - Updated application service providers and user models to support new functionalities.
  - Adjusted build configurations (`vite.config.js`, `package.json`).
  - Cleaned up `.gitignore` and added `.vercelignore`, `vercel.json` for deployment.
