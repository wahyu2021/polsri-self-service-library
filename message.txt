feat: Implement comprehensive student self-service module and refactor admin

This commit introduces a complete overhaul and expansion of the student-facing features, transforming it into a self-service library module. It also includes significant refactoring on the admin side for better separation of concerns.

**Student Module Enhancements:**
- **Revamped Dashboard:** Implemented Quick Actions for "Scan Logbook" and "Pinjam Buku", integrated Google Books API for "Inspirasi Hari Ini", and added status notifications for overdue loans.
- **Smart Logbook (Absensi):** Created a dedicated page for library check-in using QR code scanning simulation and GPS location validation (geofencing) with visual feedback.
- **Scan & Borrow (Peminjaman Mandiri):** Developed a new feature allowing students to scan book ISBNs, preview book details, and submit self-service loan requests.
- **Exit Pass (Tiket Keluar):** Introduced a dynamic page displayed after a loan request, featuring a unique transaction QR code and real-time polling to monitor admin verification status.
- **Koleksi Saya:** Created a dedicated page for students to view their active loans (with due date countdowns), loan history, and associated fine information.
- **Profil Pengguna:** Added a dedicated page for displaying student details and providing a logout option.
- **App Layout Refinement:** Modified `components/layouts/app.blade.php` to include a dynamic bottom navigation bar for student users, enhancing the mobile application experience.

**Admin Refactoring:**
- **ReportController:** Logic for report generation (metrics, top violators, daily stats) moved to `ReportService` and `LoanRepository`, cleaning up the controller.
- **SettingController:** Direct model interactions replaced by `SettingService` and a new `SettingRepository`, promoting consistency.
- **LoanController (`create` method):** Direct model queries (`User::where`, `Book::where`) replaced by service calls (`UserService::getStudents`, `BookService::getAvailableBooks`).
- **Repository Enhancements:** Added `create` method to `LogbookRepository` and `getStudents` to `UserRepository`.

**General Improvements:**
- Updated `AppServiceProvider` to correctly bind new and existing repository interfaces (`UserRepositoryInterface`, `SettingRepositoryInterface`).
- Removed redundant `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php` file.
